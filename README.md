## Usage

- Click the microphone icon in your system tray to open the microphone list
- Click any microphone in the list to select it as your active device

- The virtual microphone will appear as a new audio input device in your system
- Your selection is automatically saved and restored when you restart the app
- Use the refresh button (â†») to reload the microphone list if devices change

## Virtual Microphone

The app creates a virtual audio pipeline that:
- Captures audio from your selected physical microphone
- Processes the audio stream in real-time (voice conversion, effects, etc.)
- Routes the processed audio to a virtual audio device
- Makes the processed audio available as a system-wide microphone input

### Virtual Audio Device Setup

To use this as a system-wide virtual microphone, you need to install a virtual audio driver:

**macOS:**
- **BlackHole** (Free): Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole)
- **Loopback** (Paid): Professional audio routing tool

**Windows:**
- **VB-Audio VoiceMeeter** (Free): Virtual audio mixer
- **Virtual Audio Cable** (Free): Simple virtual audio routing

**Linux:**
- **PulseAudio**: Built-in virtual sink support
- **JACK**: Professional audio routing system

See `VIRTUAL_AUDIO_SETUP.md` for detailed installation instructions.
